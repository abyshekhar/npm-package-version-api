This project contains an API to fetch the latest released version of the npm packages.  

Sometimes we would want to know the current released version of frameworks so that we can plan to upgrade our apps accordinly.

The project uses a json file that contains the name and URL for the package and then web scrapping is done using the axios package to finally retrieve the latest version number from the npm website.
